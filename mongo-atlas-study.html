This choice significantly impacts:</p><p><strong>Network Latency</strong>: The physical distance between the client and the database can affect response times.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: Different regions may have varying pricing structures for running clusters.</p><p><strong>Cluster Configuration Options</strong>: The available tiers and features can differ based on the selected region.</p><p><strong>Supported Cloud Providers</strong></p><p>MongoDB Atlas supports deployment on the following cloud providers:</p><p><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong></p><p><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong></p><p><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong></p><p>For each provider, there are specific regions where Atlas can be deployed.</p><p><strong>Cluster Creation and Region Selection</strong></p><p>When creating a new cluster, you will encounter:</p><p><strong>Recommended Regions</strong>: Marked with a ★, these regions offer higher availability and are suggested for optimal performance.</p><p><strong>Shared Tier Limitations</strong>: Regions that are grayed-out are not available for shared tier clusters and can only be used for dedicated clusters.</p><p><strong>Fault Tolerance and High Availability:</strong></p><p><strong>Cluster Types in MongoDB Atlas</strong></p><p>MongoDB Atlas offers various types of cloud database deployments to cater to different needs. The main types include:</p><ul><li><strong>Dedicated Clusters</strong>: Ideal for high-throughput production applications.</li><li><strong>Shared Clusters and Flex Clusters</strong>: Suitable for development and small-scale applications.</li><li><strong>Global Clusters</strong>: Designed for location-aware read and write operations.</li><li><strong>Local Deployments</strong>: For testing and development on a single-node replica set.</li></ul><p><strong>Dedicated Clusters</strong></p><p>When to choose a Dedicated Cluster:</p><ul><li>You need specific database configurations based on workload requirements.</li><li>You want to define database scaling behavior.</li><li>You are running high-throughput production workloads.</li><li>You require guaranteed capacity.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features of Dedicated Clusters</strong>:</p><ul><li>Set the cluster tier based on your needs.</li><li>Utilize advanced capabilities like sharding.</li><li>Distribute data across multiple regions and cloud providers.</li><li>Scale your cluster on-demand and enable autoscaling.</li></ul><p><strong>Flex Clusters</strong></p><p>Flex Clusters are a new offering that allows for:</p><ul><li>Quick setup with minimal configuration and lower costs.</li><li>Automatic and dynamic scaling to meet workload demands.</li><li>Ideal for infrequent or sparse workloads, as well as development and testing.</li></ul><p><strong>Global Clusters</strong></p><p>Global Clusters are designed for applications that require:</p><ul><li>Low-latency read and write operations for globally distributed clients.</li><li>Uptime protection during regional outages.</li><li>Location-aware data storage in specific geographic regions.</li></ul><p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Once Global Writes are enabled for a cluster, they cannot be disabled.</p><p><strong>Local Deployments</strong></p><p>Local deployments allow you to try out Atlas features on a single-node replica set hosted on your local machine. This is useful for development and testing purposes.</p><p><strong>Feature Support and Comparison</strong></p><p>A comparison table is available to indicate which configurations and capabilities are supported by Dedicated and Flex clusters.</p><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Once you have selected a cluster type, you can proceed to create a cluster using the Atlas UI, Atlas Administration API, or Atlas CLI.</p><p><strong>Connection and Deployment Methods:</strong></p><p>To connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster, you need to follow several steps and meet specific requirements. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:</p><p><strong>1. Considerations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Host Name Consistency</strong>: Atlas does not guarantee that host names will remain consistent during topology changes (e.g., scaling the cluster).</li><li><strong>Optimized SRV Connection Strings</strong>: These are available for sharded clusters on AWS, improving performance during connection spikes.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure your cluster meets the criteria for using optimized connection strings: <ul><li>It must be a sharded cluster on AWS.</li><li>It should run MongoDB version 5.0 or later.</li><li>A private endpoint must be set up.</li><li>Use either a single-region or a multi-region cluster with regionalized private endpoints enabled.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>3. Connecting to Your Cloud Cluster</strong></p><p>To connect to your Atlas cluster, you need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Add your IP address</strong> to the IP access list in your Atlas project.</li><li><strong>Create a database user</strong> with access to the desired databases.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Connect:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Get the Connection String</strong>: You can retrieve your connection string from the Atlas UI or using the Atlas CLI. Here’s how to do it with the CLI:</li></ol><p>bash</p><p>atlas clusters connectionStrings describe &lt;clusterName&gt; [options]</p><p>Example connection string:</p><p>bash</p><p>  mongodb+srv://mycluster.abcd1.mongodb.net</p><p>  <strong>Connect Using mongosh</strong>: Use the connection string to connect to your cluster:</p><p>bash</p><ol><li>mongosh "mongodb+srv://mycluster.abcd1.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --apiVersion 1 --username &lt;username&gt;</li></ol><p>Make sure to replace &lt;username&gt; with your actual database username.</p><p><strong>4. Connecting to a Local Deployment with the Atlas CLI</strong></p><p>If you are working with a local deployment, you can connect using the Atlas CLI:</p><p>bash</p><p>atlas deployments connect [deploymentName] [options]</p><p><strong>5. Troubleshooting</strong></p><p>If you encounter issues while connecting, refer to the troubleshooting section in the Atlas documentation for guidance.</p><p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure your application can reach the MongoDB Atlas environment by allowing outbound connections on ports 27015 to 27017.</li><li>If using LDAP authentication, configure network access from Atlas clusters to your secure LDAP.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Resources</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Connect via Drivers</strong>: Driver Connection</li><li><strong>Connect via Compass</strong>: Compass Connection</li><li><strong>Connect via mongosh</strong>: Mongo Shell Connection</li><li><strong>Connect via VS Code</strong>: MongoDB for VS Code</li></ul><p>By following these steps and guidelines, you should be able to successfully connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster.</p><p><strong>Cloud Shared Responsibility Model:</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li>MongoDB's Responsibility (Control Plane): Managing the Atlas infrastructure, including hardware, networking, security of the underlying platform, software updates, and patching.</li><li>User's Responsibility (Data Plane): Managing your data, configuring security settings (user access, network access), defining backup and restore policies, schema design, and query optimization.</li><li>Exam focus: Clearly understand the division of responsibilities. MongoDB handles the infrastructure, you handle your data and its security.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Objective 1.2: Manage organization or project in Atlas.</p><p><strong>Atlas Hierarchy: </strong></p><ul><li><ul><li>Organization: The top-level entity in Atlas. Represents your company or team. Manages billing and overall access.</li><li>Project: A container for your MongoDB clusters. Allows you to isolate resources and manage access control for different applications or environments.</li><li>Cluster: The actual MongoDB deployment (replica set or sharded cluster).</li><li>Exam focus: Understand the hierarchy: Organization &gt; Project &gt; Cluster.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Resource Tags in MongoDB Atlas</strong></p><p>Resource tags in MongoDB Atlas allow you to categorize and manage your resources effectively. You can use tags to organize resources by purpose, environment, team, or billing center. Each tag consists of a key-value pair, such as environment: production.</p><p><strong>Key Features of Resource Tags</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Management</strong>: You can manage resource tags through the Atlas UI, Atlas Administration API, and Atlas CLI.</li><li><strong>Tag Structure</strong>: Each tag must contain a key and a value, with the following constraints:<ul><li>Maximum of 50 tags per cluster.</li><li>Each tag key can have a maximum of 255 characters and must be unique.</li><li>Each tag value can also have a maximum of 255 characters.</li><li>Allowed characters include letters, numbers, spaces, semi-colons, at symbols, underscores, dashes, periods, and plus signs.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Important Considerations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sensitive Information</strong>: Do not include sensitive information such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI) in your resource tags, as they can be accessed by other MongoDB services.</li><li><strong>Case Sensitivity</strong>: Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. For example, environment and Environment are treated as separate keys.</li><li><strong>Deletion of Tags</strong>: If you delete a tag, it will be removed from all associated resources.</li><li><strong>Activity Feed</strong>: Changes to resource tags are reflected in the Project Activity Feed, allowing you to track modifications.</li></ul><p><strong>Suggested Tag Keys</strong></p><p>When creating resource tags, Atlas suggests the following keys:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p><strong>Tag Key</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Description</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>application</p></td><td><p>Key for the project, service, or application of the resource.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>environment</p></td><td><p>Key for the deployment environment of the resource.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Suggested Values for environment</strong></p><p>If you select the environment tag key, the following values are suggested:</p><ul><li>development</li><li>production</li><li>staging</li><li>test</li></ul><p><strong>Tagging Strategy</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Standardization</strong>: Use a standardized format for tags and apply it consistently across all resource types.</li><li><strong>Cost Allocation</strong>: Use consistent tag keys, such as cost-center or billing-unit, to associate related resources based on billing entities or purposes.</li><li><strong>Resource Organization</strong>: Use consistent tag keys like environment, application, team, or owner to group resources effectively.</li></ul><p><strong>Managing Tags Programmatically</strong></p><p>You can manage tags across your resources using the following tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Atlas Administration API</strong></li><li><strong>Atlas CLI</strong></li><li><strong>HashiCorp Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Permissions for Tag Management</strong></p><p>To create or modify resource tags, you must have the Project Owner role for the project or the Organization Owner role on its parent organization.</p><p>Objective 1.3: Deploy a cluster in Atlas.</p><p><strong>Cluster Deployment Types: </strong></p><p>To create a new cluster in MongoDB Atlas, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>You need to have either <strong>Organization Owner</strong> or <strong>Project Owner</strong> access to the project.</li><li>It's recommended to use the same cloud provider and region for both your application and the cluster to minimize latency and costs.</li></ul><p><strong>Cluster Types</strong></p><p>You can create either a <strong>replica set</strong> or a <strong>sharded cluster</strong>. This tutorial focuses on creating a replica set.</p><p><strong>Important Considerations</strong></p><ul><li>Atlas limits the total number of nodes in a project to 40 (excluding free and flex clusters).</li><li>M30 and higher clusters are recommended for production environments.</li><li>Each Atlas project supports up to 25 clusters.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Create a Cluster Using the Atlas UI</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization and Project</strong>:<ul><li>From the <strong>Organizations</strong> menu, select the organization that contains your project.</li><li>From the <strong>Projects</strong> menu, select your desired project.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Access Clusters Page</strong>:<ul><li>Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar to navigate to the Clusters page.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Build a Cluster</strong>:<ul><li>If you have existing clusters, click <strong>Build a Cluster</strong>.</li><li>If this is your first cluster, click <strong>Build a Database</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Choose Configuration Options</strong>:<ul><li>You can either use a template with preset options or specify advanced configuration options.</li><li>For dedicated clusters higher than M10, select <strong>Go to Advanced Configuration</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Select Cluster Tier</strong>:<ul><li>Choose the appropriate tier (e.g., M10 for development or higher for production).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Specify Cluster Name</strong>:<ul><li>Enter a unique name for your cluster (up to 64 characters). Note that the first 23 characters must be unique within the project.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Create the Cluster</strong>:<ul><li>Click <strong>Create</strong> to deploy your cluster.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Example Command Using Atlas CLI</strong></p><p>To create a cluster using the Atlas CLI, you can run the following command:</p><p>bash</p><p>atlas clusters create &lt;clusterName&gt; [options]</p><p>To watch for a specific cluster to become available, use:</p><p>bash</p><p>atlas clusters watch &lt;clusterName&gt; [options]</p><p><strong>Listing Available Regions</strong></p><p>To list the available regions for new deployments, run:</p><p>bash</p><p>atlas clusters availableRegions list [options]</p><p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure that you do not include sensitive information in your cluster name or tags.</li><li>If you have a Backup Compliance Policy enabled, all new clusters will have Cloud Backup automatically enabled.</li></ul><p>By following these steps, you can successfully create a new cluster in MongoDB Atlas tailored to your application's needs.</p><p><strong>Creating a Global Cluster in MongoDB Atlas</strong></p><p>Creating a Global Cluster in MongoDB Atlas allows you to enable Global Writes, which is essential for applications that require low-latency access to data from multiple geographic locations. Here’s a detailed guide on how to create a Global Cluster:</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>You must have <strong>Organization Owner</strong> or <strong>Project Owner</strong> access to the project.</li><li>Review the <strong>Global Clusters Overview</strong> and <strong>Global Clusters Sharding Reference</strong> before proceeding.</li><li>Global Writes can only be enabled on M30 or greater sharded clusters.</li><li>Once deployed, a Global Cluster cannot be converted back to a standard sharded cluster.</li><li>Sample data cannot be loaded onto a Global Cluster.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Create a Global Cluster</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization and Project</strong>:<ul><li>From the <strong>Organizations</strong> menu, select the organization containing your project.</li><li>From the <strong>Projects</strong> menu, select your desired project.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Access Clusters Page</strong>:<ul><li>Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar to navigate to the Clusters page.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Create a New Cluster</strong>:<ul><li>If you have existing clusters, click <strong>Create</strong> to open the Create New Cluster dialog.</li><li>If this is your first cluster, click <strong>Build a Database</strong> and then select <strong>Advanced Configuration Options</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Select Cluster Type</strong>:<ul><li>In the Create New Cluster dialog, choose the <strong>Dedicated cluster type</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enable Global Writes</strong>:<ul><li>Click on <strong>Global Cluster Configuration</strong> to expand the section.</li><li>Toggle <strong>Enable Global Writes (M30 and Up)</strong> to <strong>On</strong>.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Sharding Configuration</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Atlas-Managed Sharding</strong>: This is the default option, which automatically configures shard keys and zones based on geographic location. It is recommended for most workloads.</li><li><strong>Self-Managed Sharding</strong>: For advanced users who need more control over sharding strategies. You must configure this manually using mongosh or a supported MongoDB Driver.</li></ul><p><strong>Zone Configuration</strong></p><p>Atlas provides three options for configuring Global Cluster zones:</p><ul><li><strong>Using a Template</strong>: Choose from predefined templates for quick setup.</li><li><strong>Single Region Zone</strong>: Configure a zone that operates within a single region.</li><li><strong>Multi Region Zone</strong>: Configure zones that span multiple regions.</li></ul><p><strong>Important Considerations</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot switch between Atlas-Managed and Self-Managed Sharding after deployment.</li><li>Each cloud provider has specific global regions available for zone deployment, which may affect your configuration options and costs.</li><li>You can add up to <strong>nine zones</strong> to a Global Cluster. If you need more, contact Atlas support.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Configuration Options</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Electable Nodes</strong>: Configure the number of electable nodes for high availability.</li><li><strong>Read-only Nodes</strong>: Add read-only nodes to facilitate local secondary read operations.</li><li><strong>Analytics Nodes</strong>: Use analytics nodes to isolate queries from operational workloads.</li></ul><p><strong>Removing Zones</strong></p><p>If you remove a zone from an existing Global Cluster, it may result in a new connection string if using the standard connection string format. Always verify the connection string after making changes.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Creating a Global Cluster in MongoDB Atlas involves careful planning and configuration to ensure optimal performance and availability across different geographic locations. By following the steps outlined above, you can successfully set up a Global Cluster tailored to your application's needs.</p><p>Objective 1.4: Manage documents in cluster collections.</p><p><strong>Interact with Your Data in MongoDB Atlas</strong></p><p>After loading your data or using the sample data provided by MongoDB, you can utilize the Atlas UI to interact with your data in several ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Manage Databases</strong>: You can create, modify, and delete databases within your clusters.</li><li><strong>Manage Collections</strong>: This allows you to create, update, and delete collections in your databases.</li><li><strong>Manage Documents</strong>: You can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on documents within your collections.</li><li><strong>Manage Indexes</strong>: Create and manage indexes to optimize query performance on your collections.</li><li><strong>Create and Run Aggregation Pipelines</strong>: Use aggregation pipelines to process and analyze data in your collections.</li><li><strong>Shard Global Clusters</strong>: Distribute large datasets evenly across multiple shards for better performance and scalability.</li><li><strong>Build Charts</strong>: Visualize your data using charts to gain insights and present information effectively.</li></ul><p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Primary Read Preference</strong>: The Atlas UI reads from the primary node unless it is unavailable.

Atlas migrates one member at a time, starting with secondary members, which may affect performance if the primary is already at capacity.</li><li><strong>VPC Peering Connections</strong>: If you move a cluster out of a region with a VPC peering connection, the moved cluster will lose access to that connection. You can create new VPC connections for the new region.</li><li><strong>IP Access List</strong>: Cluster nodes removed from a region cannot inherit access rules from an AWS security group or allowed VPC CIDR blocks configured for the VPC peering connection. You must configure IP access list entries for all virtual servers in the VPC.</li><li><strong>Billing for Storage</strong>: If you change the highest priority region or migrate oplog data, you will be billed for storage in both the old and new regions for the days following the change. Disabling and re-enabling continuous cloud backup can prevent double billing.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Move a Cluster</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization</strong>: Choose the organization that contains your desired project from the Organizations menu in the navigation bar.</li><li><strong>Select Project</strong>: Choose your desired project from the Projects menu.</li><li><strong>Access Clusters</strong>: Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar to view your clusters.</li><li><strong>Edit Configuration</strong>: Click <strong>Edit Config</strong> and select the cluster you want to move from the drop-down menu.

This feature allows you to manage your encryption keys through your cloud provider's Key Management Service (KMS). Below is a detailed overview of the key points related to this feature.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Default Encryption</strong>: Atlas encrypts all cluster storage and snapshot volumes at rest by default. You can add an additional layer of security by using your cloud provider's KMS along with the MongoDB encrypted storage engine.</li><li><strong>Supported KMS Providers</strong>:<ul><li><strong>Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (AWS KMS)</strong></li><li><strong>Azure Key Vault</strong></li><li><strong>Google Cloud Platform Key Management Service (GCP KMS)</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Configuration Requirements</strong>:<ul><li>You must have <strong>Project Owner</strong> access to configure customer key management.</li><li>Valid key management provider credentials and an encryption key are required.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Configure Customer Key Management</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization and Project</strong>:<ul><li>Choose the organization that contains your project from the Organizations menu.</li><li>Select your project from the Projects menu.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Access Advanced Settings</strong>:<ul><li>In the sidebar, click <strong>Advanced</strong> under the Security heading.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enable Customer Key Management</strong>:<ul><li>Toggle the <strong>Manage your own encryption keys</strong> setting to <strong>Yes</strong> on the cluster configuration form.</li><li>Click <strong>Review Changes</strong> and then <strong>Apply Changes</strong> to deploy your cluster.</li></ul></li><li><strong>IP Access List</strong>:<ul><li>Depending on your KMS configuration, you may need to add Atlas control plane IP addresses to your cloud provider's access list to enable communication between Atlas and KMS.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Validate KMS Configuration</strong>:<ul><li>Atlas validates your KMS configuration when you add or update credentials, every 15 minutes, and on-demand.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Important Considerations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cluster Availability</strong>: If your KMS provider becomes unavailable, your cluster will not be disabled while it is running. However, if you restart your cluster, the lack of a KMS provider will disable it.</li><li><strong>Key Rotation</strong>: Atlas cannot rotate customer-managed encryption keys. Refer to your KMS provider's documentation for guidance on key rotation.</li><li><strong>Restoring Deleted Keys</strong>: If a key is deleted, you must restore it to regain access to your clusters. Each KMS provider has its own method for restoring keys.</li></ul><p><strong>Encrypted Backups</strong></p><ul><li>Atlas encrypts all snapshot volumes, securing your cluster data on disk. You can also encrypt your snapshot storage volumes and access encrypted snapshots.</li><li>To restore snapshots, you must use the key that was active at the time the snapshot was taken.</li></ul><p><strong>Manage Customer Keys with AWS KMS</strong></p><p>This page provides detailed instructions on how to manage customer-managed keys using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) in MongoDB Atlas. Below are the key sections and procedures outlined in the documentation.</p><p><strong>Required Access</strong></p><ul><li>You must have <strong>Project Owner</strong> access to configure customer key management for your Atlas project.</li><li>Users with <strong>Organization Owner</strong> access must add themselves as a Project Owner to manage keys.</li></ul><p><strong>Enable Customer-Managed Keys with AWS KMS</strong></p><p>To enable customer-managed keys for your Atlas project, you need to configure AWS IAM roles instead of IAM users. This change enhances security and simplifies access management.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><p>Here’s an example of how to set up AWS KMS for customer-managed keys:</p><ol><li><strong>Create a Symmetric AWS KMS Key</strong>: Follow the AWS documentation to create a symmetric key.</li><li><strong>Configure IAM Role</strong>: Ensure the IAM role has permissions to perform actions like DescribeKey, Encrypt, and Decrypt.</li></ol><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Use an <strong>M10 or larger cluster</strong>.</li><li>Ensure you have a <strong>symmetric AWS KMS key</strong>.</li><li>Configure an <strong>AWS IAM role</strong> with sufficient privileges.</li></ul><p><strong>Enable Role-Based Access to Your Encryption Key for a Project</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization and Project</strong>: Choose the organization and project from the navigation menu.</li><li><strong>Access Advanced Settings</strong>: Click on <strong>Advanced</strong> under the Security heading in the sidebar.</li></ol><p><strong>Rotate Your AWS Customer Master Key</strong></p><p>You can rotate your AWS Customer Master Key (CMK) to enhance security. Follow AWS guidelines for key rotation.</p><p><strong>MongoDB Master Key - MongoDB Responsibility</strong></p><p>MongoDB manages the MongoDB Master Key, which is used to encrypt per-database encryption keys.</p><p><strong>Your AWS CMK - Your Responsibility</strong></p><p>You are responsible for managing your AWS CMK, including permissions and access.</p><p><strong>Procedure</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Configure Customer Key Management</strong>: Set up customer key management for your Atlas project before enabling it on clusters.</li><li><strong>Allow Access from Atlas IP Addresses</strong>: Ensure that your AWS KMS configuration allows access from Atlas IP addresses.</li></ol><p><strong>Reconfigure AWS KMS Region During an Outage</strong></p><p>In case of a regional outage, you may need to reconfigure your AWS KMS region.

Here’s a detailed overview of how encryption works in Atlas, especially when using Customer Key Management.</p><p><strong>Encryption Overview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Standard Encryption</strong>: All snapshots are encrypted using the cloud provider's standard encryption methods, which are managed by the provider.</li><li><strong>Customer Key Management</strong>: If you enable <strong>Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management</strong>, Atlas applies an additional layer of encryption to your snapshots using the Key Management Service (KMS) provider.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Management Service (KMS) Providers</strong></p><ol><li><strong>AWS KMS</strong>:<ul><li>For clusters using AWS IAM as their KMS, Atlas utilizes the project's customer master key (CMK) and AWS IAM user or role credentials at the time of the snapshot.</li><li>This provides an additional layer of encryption on top of the existing encryption applied to all Atlas storage and snapshot volumes.</li><li>Oplog data collected for point-in-time (PIT) restores is also encrypted with the customer's CMK.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Azure Key Vault</strong>:<ul><li>For clusters using Azure Key Vault as their KMS, Atlas uses the project's Key Identifier, Key Vault Credentials, and Active Directory application account credentials at the time of the snapshot.</li><li>Similar to AWS, this adds an additional layer of encryption to the existing storage encryption.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Accessing and Managing Encrypted Snapshots</strong></p><p><strong>Viewing the Key Used to Encrypt a Snapshot</strong></p><p>To view the encryption key ID for a snapshot:</p><ol><li>Select the organization that contains your project from the Organizations menu.</li><li>Select your desired project from the Projects menu.</li><li>Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar.</li><li>Click your cluster's name.</li><li>Click the <strong>Backup</strong> tab. If the cluster has no Backup tab, backups are disabled for that cluster.</li><li>Note the Encryption Key ID for each snapshot. Atlas lists the Key Identifier used to encrypt the snapshot. Unencrypted snapshots will display "Not enabled."</li></ol><p><strong>Important Considerations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Restoration Requirements</strong>: Atlas requires access to the encryption key associated with the snapshot's Encryption Key ID to successfully restore that snapshot.</li><li><strong>Deleting Encryption Keys</strong>: Before deleting an Encryption Key ID, check all backup-enabled clusters in the project for any snapshots still using that key. Once an encryption key is deleted, all snapshots encrypted with that key become inaccessible and unrecoverable.</li><li><strong>Automatic Deletion of Backups</strong>: Atlas automatically deletes backups according to the backup scheduling and retention policies. Once all snapshots depending on a given Encryption Key ID are deleted, you can safely delete the key.</li><li><strong>Disabling Encryption Keys</strong>: If you disable an Encryption Key ID, you must re-enable it before restoring a snapshot encrypted with that key.</li></ul><p><strong>Access an Encrypted Snapshot in MongoDB Atlas</strong></p><p>When using <strong>Encryption at Rest</strong> with <strong>Customer Key Management</strong> in MongoDB Atlas, the mongod data files in your snapshots are encrypted. To access and restore these snapshots, you need to ensure that the mongod instance can access a KMIP (Key Management Interoperability Protocol) server that provides the appropriate decryption key. Below are the steps and considerations for accessing an encrypted snapshot.</p><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>KMIP Proxy Standalone</strong>: You will need to download the KMIP Proxy Standalone binary for your operating system to access the encrypted data files.</li><li><strong>Credentials</strong>: By default, the KMIP Proxy uses credentials stored in the /&lt;dbPath&gt;/cloudProviderCredentials/&lt;keyID&gt;.&lt;cloudProvider&gt;.metadata file. If you rotate keys, these credentials will reflect the latest key rotation.</li><li><strong>Role-Based Access</strong>: If you use role-based access to your encryption key, the metadata file may not contain valid credentials. You will need to update it or provide temporary credentials.</li></ul><p><strong>Example Metadata File Update</strong></p><p>If you need to update the metadata file, it should look like this:</p><p>json</p><p>{</p><p>  "accessKeyId": "TemporaryAccessKeyId",</p><p>  "secretAccessKey": "TemporarySecretAccessKey",</p><p>  "roleId": "",</p><p>  "region": "us-east-1"</p><p>}</p><p><strong>Procedure to Access an Encrypted Snapshot</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Your Organization and Project</strong>:<ul><li>From the Organizations menu, select the organization that contains your project.</li><li>From the Projects menu, select your desired project.</li><li>Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Access the Backup Tab</strong>:<ul><li>Click on your cluster's name.</li><li>Click the <strong>Backup</strong> tab.

Here’s a detailed overview of the requirements, limitations, and steps to perform the restoration.</p><p><strong>Requirements and Limitations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cluster Type</strong>: This feature is only available for M10+ dedicated clusters.</li><li><strong>Encryption Provider</strong>: You can only restore to a cluster that uses the same encryption provider as the source cluster. Snapshots taken from clusters without Encryption at Rest cannot be restored to a cluster with it.</li><li><strong>DefaultRWConcern</strong>: If the DefaultRWConcern value on the source snapshot differs from the target cluster, Atlas overrides the value on the source snapshot with the value on the target cluster.</li><li><strong>Project Compatibility</strong>: When restoring from a snapshot in a different project, ensure that the target project has a cluster with Encryption at Rest enabled. If not, you can either deploy a new cluster with Encryption at Rest or enable it in an existing cluster.</li><li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>: Atlas deletes all existing data on the target cluster prior to the restore. The target cluster may be unavailable during the restoration process.</li></ul><p><strong>Optimization Tips</strong></p><p>To optimize performance and reduce the time it takes to restore, consider the following:</p><ul><li>Select a target cluster that isn't global or multi-cloud.</li><li>Ensure the target cluster belongs to the same Atlas project and cloud provider region as the snapshot.</li><li>Choose a cluster tier with the same storage capacity as the original volume used by the source cluster.</li><li>If using AWS, select configured IOPS that fall within the configured range.</li><li>Avoid using NVMe storage for the target cluster, as it can degrade restore performance.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Restore from a Snapshot</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization and Project</strong>:<ul><li>From the Organizations menu, select the organization containing your desired project.</li><li>From the Projects menu, select your project.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Access Clusters</strong>:<ul><li>Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar to display the Clusters page.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Select Cluster</strong>:<ul><li>Click on your cluster's name.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Open Backup Tab</strong>:<ul><li>Click the <strong>Backup</strong> tab.

Here’s a detailed overview of how to manage exports, including supported services, export formats, and required configurations.</p><p><strong>Supported Storage Services</strong></p><p>Atlas currently supports the following object storage services for exporting snapshots:</p><ul><li><strong>AWS S3 buckets</strong></li><li><strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong></li></ul><p><strong>How Atlas Exports Snapshots</strong></p><p>You can manually export individual snapshots or set up an export policy for automatic exports. The export policy requires you to specify a frequency:</p><ul><li>Daily</li><li>Weekly</li><li>Monthly</li><li>Yearly</li></ul><p>Atlas will automatically export any backup snapshot that matches the specified export frequency.</p><p><strong>Example Scenario</strong></p><p>If you have a backup policy that sets a weekly and monthly snapshot schedule, and an export policy that sets a monthly export frequency, Atlas will export only the monthly snapshot if it coincides with the weekly snapshot. To export weekly snapshots as well, you would need to update the export policy to include weekly exports.</p><p><strong>Exported Data Format</strong></p><p>Atlas exports documents in gzip-compressed Extended JSON (v2) format. The exported files are stored in the following path on your object store:</p><p>/exported_snapshots/&lt;orgName&gt;/&lt;projectName&gt;/&lt;clusterName&gt;/&lt;initiationDateOfSnapshot&gt;/&lt;timestamp&gt;/&lt;dbName&gt;/&lt;collectionName&gt;/&lt;shardName&gt;.&lt;increment&gt;.json.gz</p><p><strong>Path Components</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th><p><strong>Component</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Description</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>&lt;orgName&gt;</p></td><td><p>Name of your Atlas organization.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;projectName&gt;</p></td><td><p>Name of your Atlas project.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;clusterName&gt;</p></td><td><p>Name of your Atlas cluster.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;initiationDateOfSnapshot&gt;</p></td><td><p>Date when the snapshot was taken.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;timestamp&gt;</p></td><td><p>Timestamp when the export job was created.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;dbName&gt;</p></td><td><p>Name of the database in the Atlas cluster.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;collectionName&gt;</p></td><td><p>Name of the Atlas collection.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;shardName&gt;</p></td><td><p>Name of the replica set or primary shard.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;increment&gt;</p></td><td><p>Count that increments as chunks are uploaded.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Limitations</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot export fallback snapshots.</li><li>Only one active export per snapshot is allowed.</li><li>Exporting view collections or system collections (except for &lt;database&gt;.system.js) is not supported.</li><li>Snapshots from clusters with IP-restricted Encryption at Rest enabled cannot be exported.</li><li>Snapshots from projects configured for Private Endpoints cannot be exported.</li></ul><p><strong>Required Access</strong></p><p>To manage Cloud Backup snapshots, you must have Project Owner access.

Here’s a comprehensive overview of the restoration process, including required access, limitations, prerequisites, and how to view the status of snapshot restorations.</p><p><strong>Required Access</strong></p><p>To view cloud backup restore jobs, you must have <strong>Project Owner</strong> access or higher in the project.</p><p><strong>Limitations</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot restore a snapshot created from a MongoDB 7.0 sharded cluster with 3 or fewer shards to a MongoDB 8.0 sharded cluster with 3 or fewer shards using the default embedded config server configuration. You must first disable the Managed Configs to create a sharded cluster with a dedicated config server before restoring the snapshot.</li></ul><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure that the target Atlas cluster does not receive client requests during the restoration process. For maximum uptime, consider restoring to a new cluster and reconfiguring your application to use that new cluster once it is operational.</li></ul><p><strong>Restoration Methods</strong></p><p>You can restore data from:</p><ul><li><strong>Scheduled and On-Demand Snapshots</strong>: Restore from snapshots that were created based on your backup policy or manually.</li><li><strong>Continuous Cloud Backup</strong>: Restore from continuous backups that capture changes in real-time.</li><li><strong>Locally Downloaded Snapshot Files</strong>: Restore from snapshots that you have downloaded to your local environment.</li><li><strong>Snapshots of a Cluster Using Encryption at Rest with Customer Key Management</strong>: Restore from encrypted snapshots.</li><li><strong>Cloud Manager Deployment</strong>: Restore from backups taken in a Cloud Manager deployment.</li></ul><p><strong>Viewing Status of Snapshot Restorations</strong></p><p>To list all cloud backup restore jobs for your cluster using the Atlas CLI, you can run the following command:</p><p>bash</p><p>atlas backups restores describe &lt;restoreJobId&gt; [options]</p><p>To return the details for a specific cloud backup restore job, use:</p><p>bash</p><p>atlas backups restores describe &lt;restoreJobId&gt; [options]</p><p>To view all cloud backup restore jobs for a specified serverless instance in your project, run:</p><p>bash</p><p>atlas serverless backups restores describe [options]</p><p><strong>Steps to View Restoration Status in the Atlas UI</strong></p><ol><li>Select the organization that contains your desired project from the Organizations menu in the navigation bar.</li><li>Select your desired project from the Projects menu.</li><li>Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar.</li><li>Click your cluster's name.</li><li>Click the <strong>Backup</strong> tab. If the cluster has no Backup tab, then Atlas backups are disabled for that cluster.</li></ol><p>The <strong>Backup</strong> page displays the status of completed and in-progress snapshot restorations, including when Atlas took the snapshot and the snapshot's delivery type.</p><ul><li>For manually downloaded snapshots, the Status column displays progress while Atlas prepares the download link.

When the restoration completes, the column displays the time of completion and the cluster to which Atlas restored the snapshot.</li></ul><p><strong>Restore from a Scheduled or On-Demand Snapshot in MongoDB Atlas</strong></p><p>MongoDB Atlas allows you to restore data from scheduled or on-demand Cloud Backups, including snapshots from different projects or organizations. Below are the key points and steps to perform a restoration.</p><p><strong>Key Considerations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cross-Organization Restores</strong>: You can only perform cross-organization restores through the Atlas UI.</li><li><strong>DefaultRWConcern</strong>: If the DefaultRWConcern value on the source snapshot differs from the target cluster, Atlas overrides the value on the source snapshot with the value on the target cluster.</li><li><strong>Cluster Types</strong>: This feature is not available for M0 clusters. For M10+ dedicated clusters running MongoDB 4.2 or higher, Atlas restores Atlas Search index definitions from a Cloud Backup snapshot, but it does not restore search index data.</li><li><strong>Sharded Clusters</strong>: If you are restoring from a sharded cluster, the source and target clusters must have the same number of shards. Atlas cannot restore a sharded cluster snapshot to a replica set.</li><li><strong>Migration from Shared Clusters</strong>: If your cluster has been migrated from an M2 or M5 cluster to a Flex cluster, you have access to the last 8 backup snapshots since the date of the migration.</li><li><strong>Snapshot Compatibility</strong>: Starting with MongoDB 5.0, you can restore snapshots of clusters that run only the two most recent major versions of MongoDB to M2 and M5 clusters.</li><li><strong>Fallback Snapshots</strong>: If a scheduled snapshot fails, Atlas attempts to repeat the snapshot process. You may use the resulting fallback snapshot to restore the cluster, but this is not recommended as fallback snapshots may contain inconsistent data.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Restore from a Snapshot</strong></p><p><strong>Using the Atlas UI</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization and Project</strong>:<ul><li>From the Organizations menu, select the organization that contains your desired project.</li><li>From the Projects menu, select your project.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Access Clusters</strong>:<ul><li>Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Select Cluster</strong>:<ul><li>Click on your cluster's name.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Open Backup Tab</strong>:<ul><li>Click the <strong>Backup</strong> tab.

This helps in optimizing storage costs while maintaining access to archived data.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Archiving Process</strong>: Atlas archives data based on specified criteria in an archiving rule. The criteria can vary depending on the type of collection (standard or time series).</li><li><strong>Federated Database Instances</strong>: When you configure an Online Archive, Atlas creates two federated database instances:<ul><li>One for querying archived data only.</li><li>Another for querying both your cluster and archived data.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Cluster Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Online Archive is available only on M10 and greater clusters.</li></ul><p><strong>Required Permissions</strong></p><p>To create or delete an Online Archive, you must have one of the following roles:</p><ul><li><strong>Project Data Access Admin</strong></li><li><strong>Project Cluster Manager</strong></li><li><strong>Project Owner</strong></li></ul><p><strong>How Atlas Archives Data</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Job Execution</strong>: Atlas runs a query in the archive's namespace to identify documents that match the archiving criteria. This query is referred to as a <em>job</em>.<ul><li>By default, Atlas runs the job every five minutes, expanding the interval if the document size does not meet the threshold.</li><li>The threshold is 2GB per job.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data Writing</strong>: For documents that match the archival criteria, Atlas:<ul><li>Writes to a maximum of 10,000 partitions per data archiving job.</li><li>Writes up to 2GB of document data to partitions on cloud object storage for each unique combination of query field values.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Limitations</strong></p><ul><li>Online Archive does not support: <ul><li>Writing to the Online Archive.</li><li>Archiving capped collections.</li><li>Archiving data below the size of 5 MiB after 7 days.</li></ul></li><li>The Online Archive is read-only, and Atlas does not update archived data.</li></ul><p><strong>Viewing the Online Archive</strong></p><p>To view your federated database instance for the Online Archive:</p><ol><li>Select the organization that contains your project from the Organizations menu.</li><li>Select your project from the Projects menu.</li><li>Click on <strong>Data Federation</strong> under the Services heading.</li></ol><p><strong>Querying the Online Archive</strong></p><p>You can query your Online Archive data using the connection string through the Online Archive or federated database instance. You can also use SQL to query the archived data.</p><p><strong>Managing Query Limits for Online Archive</strong></p><p>You can configure limits on the amount of data processed for queries against archived data to control costs. If the processed data reaches the configured limit, Atlas will not execute new queries and will return an error.</p><p><strong>Editing and Deleting Online Archives</strong></p><p>You can edit archiving rules, delete your Online Archive, or pause archiving through the Atlas console.</p><p><strong>Online Archive Costs</strong></p><p>While Online Archive helps lower storage costs, you will incur costs for the amount of data transferred and queried.</p><p><strong>Domain 5: Logging (6%)</strong></p><p>Objective 5.1: Review activity from Activity Feed.</p><p>Ref-- Objective 3.3</p><p>Objective 5.2: Retrieve log data.</p><p><strong>View and Download MongoDB Logs</strong></p><p>MongoDB logs are crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting your database instances.

alerts.</p><p><strong>Alert Basics in MongoDB Atlas</strong></p><p>MongoDB Atlas provides built-in tools to help monitor your clusters effectively through alerts. Here’s a detailed overview of how alerts function and their significance:</p><p><strong>Key Features of Alerts</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Trigger Conditions</strong>: Alerts can be triggered by a variety of conditions related to your databases, users, accounts, and more. You can find the specific conditions here.</li><li><strong>Configuration</strong>: You can configure alert settings based on specific conditions. This allows you to tailor alerts to your operational needs. More details on configuring alerts can be found here.</li><li><strong>Resolution</strong>: When alerts are triggered, you can resolve them by addressing the immediate issue and implementing long-term solutions. Guidance on resolving alerts is available here.</li></ol><p><strong>Alert Notifications</strong></p><ul><li>When a condition triggers an alert, Atlas displays a warning symbol on the cluster and sends notifications based on your alert settings. Notifications continue until the condition is resolved or the alert is deleted/disabled.</li></ul><p><strong>Monitoring Metrics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tickets Available</strong>: This metric helps monitor the number of concurrent read or write operations. You can view this on the Tickets Available chart through cluster monitoring.</li><li><strong>Queues</strong>: This metric measures operations waiting on locks and can be viewed on the Queues chart, also accessible through cluster monitoring.</li><li><strong>CPU Steal</strong>: For AWS EC2 clusters, this condition measures the percentage by which CPU usage exceeds the guaranteed baseline CPU credit accumulation rate. You can view CPU usage on the Normalized System CPU chart.</li><li><strong>Query Targeting</strong>: Alerts related to query performance help identify inefficient queries. You can view these metrics on the Query Targeting chart.</li><li><strong>Connection Limits</strong>: Each Atlas instance has a connection limit, and alerts can help you proactively manage scaling needs or issues related to connection availability.</li></ul><p><strong>Configuring Alerts</strong></p><ul><li>You can configure alerts at both the organization and project levels. Atlas provides default alerts at the project level, and you can clone existing alerts or set maintenance window alerts.</li><li>Experiment with alert condition values based on your specific requirements and periodically reassess these values for optimal performance.</li></ul><p><strong>Common Alert Conditions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Low Metrics</strong>: Configure alerts to trigger if metrics drop below a certain threshold for a specified duration to avoid false positives.</li><li><strong>High Metrics</strong>: Set alerts for when metrics exceed a certain threshold to catch issues when they persist over time.</li><li><strong>Connection Alerts</strong>: These typically occur when the maximum number of allowable connections is exceeded.</li></ul><p><strong>Alert Lifecycle</strong></p><p>When an alert condition is met, the alert lifecycle begins.

Here’s a detailed overview of how it suggests and ranks indexes:</p><p><strong>How Performance Advisor Suggests and Ranks Indexes</strong></p><p>The Performance Advisor monitors queries that take longer than <strong>100 milliseconds</strong> to execute and groups these queries into common <strong>query shapes</strong>. It calculates the inefficiency of each query shape using several aggregated metrics, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Execution Time</strong>: The total time spent executing the query.</li><li><strong>Documents Scanned</strong>: The number of documents scanned during the query.</li><li><strong>Documents Returned</strong>: The number of documents returned by the query.</li><li><strong>Average Object Size</strong>: The average size of the objects being queried.</li></ul><p>Using these metrics, the Performance Advisor calculates the <strong>Impact</strong> of creating an index that matches a specific query shape. The Impact reflects the estimated performance improvement that the suggested index would provide, primarily determined by the total wasted bytes read.</p><p><strong>Index Field Order</strong></p><p>The order of fields in the suggested indexes is influenced by the type of query operation. Generally, the Performance Advisor ranks fields by their <strong>cardinality</strong>, which refers to the uniqueness of the values in a field.</p><p><strong>Limiting Proposed Indexes</strong></p><p>The Performance Advisor does not suggest indexes with more than <strong>16 fields</strong>. Additionally, it only suggests indexes if the difference between scanned documents and returned documents exceeds <strong>500</strong> for impacted queries.</p><p>To avoid redundancy, the Performance Advisor de-duplicates overlapping indexes. For example, if it calculates potential suggested indexes like { a : 1 } and { a : 1, b : 1 }, it will only suggest { a : 1, b : 1 } since the first is a prefix of the second.</p><p><strong>Example: New York City Taxi Data</strong></p><p>Consider a database named cab-db that contains information about New York City taxi rides. A typical document in the yellow collection might look like this:</p><p>json</p><p>{</p><p>  "_id": ObjectId("5db9daab0b2a17b7706cd6a3"),</p><p>  "pickup_datetime": "2014-06-30 02:09:23",</p><p>  "dropoff_datetime": "2014-06-30 02:20:36",</p><p>  "passenger_count": 2,</p><p>  "trip_distance": 3,</p><p>  "fare_amount": 12,</p><p>  "tip_amount": 2.6,</p><p>  "total_amount": 15.6</p><p>}</p><p>With over <strong>10 million documents</strong>, efficient indexing is crucial for performance. Typical queries might search for documents based on specific dropoff times and other fields, such as:</p><p>javascript</p><p>db.yellow.find({</p><p>  "dropoff_datetime": "2014-06-19 21:45:00",</p><p>  "passenger_count": 1,</p><p>  "trip_distance": { "$gt": 3 }</p><p>});</p><p>The Performance Advisor would recommend indexes to improve performance, such as an index on:</p><ul><li>passenger_count</li><li>dropoff_datetime</li><li>trip_distance</li></ul><p><strong>Creating Suggested Indexes</strong></p><p>You can create the suggested indexes directly from the Performance Advisor interface. By doing so, you eliminate the need for the database engine to scan the entire collection, significantly improving query performance. Queries with the suggested index can return results in <strong>50 milliseconds or less</strong>, compared to several seconds without the index.</p><p><strong>Additional Notes</strong></p><ul><li>The Performance Advisor shows index recommendations for all collections by default, but you can narrow down the recommendations to a specific collection.</li><li>You can also create indexes using the Atlas UI.</li></ul><p><strong>Review Drop Index Recommendations</strong></p><p>The Performance Advisor in MongoDB Atlas suggests dropping unused, redundant, and hidden indexes to enhance write performance and free up storage space.</p><p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Unused Indexes</strong>: An index is considered unused if it hasn't supported any queries for 7 or more days after its creation or after the server was restarted. The Performance Advisor inspects only the 20 most active collections for unused indexes.</li><li><strong>Redundant Indexes</strong>: An index is flagged as redundant if another index supports any query that it could. For example, if a collection has the following indexes:<ul><li>{ a: 1 }</li><li>{ b: -1 }</li><li>{ a: 1, b: -1 }</li></ul></li></ul><p>The index { a: 1 } is redundant because it matches the prefix of { a: 1, b: -1 }. The redundant indexes are marked with a red Redundant badge in the Performance Advisor.</p><ul><li><strong>Hidden Indexes</strong>: Atlas does not use hidden indexes to support queries, but they still impact write performance and consume storage space. You can hide an index to evaluate the impact of dropping it before making a final decision. Unhiding an index is quicker than rebuilding a dropped index.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><ul><li>The Performance Advisor always recommends dropping hidden indexes. If you determine that a hidden index is unnecessary, it should be dropped.</li><li>The Performance Advisor displays hidden indexes from your top 20 most active namespaces at the time the page is loaded. If you have more than 20 namespaces, not all hidden indexes may be displayed.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps to Drop or Hide an Index</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization and Project</strong>: Choose the organization and project from the navigation bar.</li><li><strong>Access Clusters</strong>: Click on <strong>Clusters</strong> in the sidebar.</li><li><strong>Performance Advisor</strong>: In the Performance Advisor tab, click <strong>Explore Recommendations</strong> on the Drop Indexes card.</li><li><strong>Select Host</strong>: By default, results correspond to one of the primary hosts, but you can select another host from the drop-down.</li><li><strong>Dialog Box</strong>: The Performance Advisor displays a dialog box with a link to the Atlas UI and a copyable MongoDB Shell command to drop or hide the index.</li><li><strong>Using Atlas UI</strong>: Click the <strong>Indexes</strong> tab, then click the <strong>Drop Index</strong> or <strong>Hide Index</strong> icon next to the index. Confirm your selection in the dialog box.</li><li><strong>Using MongoDB Shell</strong>: Paste and run the command provided by the Performance Advisor to drop or hide the index.</li></ol><p><strong>Enable or Disable Performance Advisor for a Project</strong></p><p>The Performance Advisor in MongoDB Atlas is a valuable tool that helps optimize query performance by suggesting indexes based on query patterns.

This setting is optional and typically not required, as Atlas performs maintenance automatically in a rolling manner to ensure continuous availability.</li><li><strong>Urgent Maintenance</strong>: Atlas will perform urgent maintenance activities, such as security patches, immediately without regard to scheduled maintenance windows.</li><li><strong>Non-Urgent Updates</strong>: Some updates that do not require a mongod restart may also occur outside of scheduled maintenance windows.</li></ul><p><strong>Required Access</strong></p><p>To manage maintenance windows, you must have either the Organization Owner or Project Owner role for the project.</p><p><strong>Procedure to Configure Maintenance Window</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Select Organization</strong>: Choose the organization that contains your project from the Organizations menu.</li><li><strong>Select Project</strong>: Choose your desired project from the Projects menu.</li><li><strong>Access Project Settings</strong>: Expand the Options menu next to the Projects menu and click on Project Settings.</li></ol><p><strong>Using the Atlas CLI</strong></p><ul><li>To return details for the maintenance window, use: </li></ul><p>bash</p><p>  atlas maintenanceWindows describe [options]</p><p>  To update the maintenance window, use: </p><p>bash</p><ul><li>atlas maintenanceWindows update [options]</li></ul><p><strong>Configuring Maintenance Window in Atlas UI</strong></p><ol><li>Toggle the <strong>Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time</strong> setting to On.</li><li>Click to set the Maintenance Start Time, which will display in your Profile's time zone.</li><li>Set the desired day and time for maintenance.</li><li>Optionally, click to automatically defer any scheduled maintenance for one week.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to apply changes or <strong>Cancel</strong> to discard them.</li></ol><p><strong>Clearing the Maintenance Window</strong></p><ul><li>To clear the configured maintenance window using the Atlas CLI: </li></ul><p>bash</p><ul><li>atlas maintenanceWindows clear [options]</li><li>In the Atlas UI, toggle the <strong>Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time</strong> setting to Off.</li></ul><p><strong>Responding to Required Maintenance</strong></p><ul><li>Atlas will display a banner in your project's cluster list showing the scheduled maintenance date and time.</li><li>Users with the Project Owner role will receive an email notification 48 to 72 hours before the scheduled maintenance.</li></ul><p><strong>Defer Maintenance</strong></p><ul><li>To defer the maintenance window using the Atlas CLI: </li></ul><p>bash</p><ul><li>atlas maintenanceWindows defer [options]</li></ul><p><strong>Options During Maintenance</strong></p><p>When maintenance is required, you can choose one of the following options in the Atlas UI:</p><ol><li><strong>Do nothing</strong>: Maintenance occurs during the scheduled window.</li><li><strong>Begin Maintenance Now</strong>: Starts the scheduled maintenance immediately.</li><li><strong>Defer Maintenance for One Week</strong>: Reschedules the maintenance for one week later.</li></ol><p><strong>Maintenance Version Upgrades</strong></p><p>If a MongoDB version upgrade is scheduled during the maintenance window, the cluster's card will display the target MongoDB maintenance version.</p>
